# DrowsinessDetectionSystem
A Drowsiness Detection System monitors the driver's alertness by analyzing eye movements, such as blinking patterns and gaze direction. If it detects signs of fatigue, it triggers an alert to warn the driver, helping prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. This system enhances road safety, especially during long drives.
